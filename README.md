# Mobula Feedbacks

Introducing Mobula feedbacks, for the community to quickly add new feature ideas and express their frustration on bugs.

## Code of conduct

### No Github account, don't wanna sign up? 

It's all good! Don't worry. You can fill out [this form](https://form.typeform.com/to/C8sF75e5) for bug report and [this form](https://form.typeform.com/to/zCxQIUXO) for new features/ideas. 

### Bug report

To report a bug, you must create an "Issue" on Github. 

### New feature/idea

To share an idea with the community, you must use the Discussions tab, and create a new discussion. You need to chose between "New feature" and "Experience improvement" - how to do so? Simply check if your idea is something that solves an existing pain-point on the app (i.e. you can't find easily your profile page from the main page) or if it's creating extra value, extending the possibilities of the app.

## MOBL Rewards

### Bug bounty

- Low severity : 50 MOBL
- Medium severity : 200 MOBL
- High severity : 1000 MOBL

Severity depends on how many users the bug impacts, and how deep it impacts their experience, i.e. a data bug on a blue chip asset is a high severity bug, while a button not working only on a specific android version on a forum page is a low severity bug.

### New features

New features adopted by the community are rewarded 200 MOBL, or more if decided by the DAO for really specific cases.

NB: rewards only applies to people taking the time to use Github for the feedbacks.

Thanks a lot for your contributions ❤️
